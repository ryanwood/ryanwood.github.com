  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> for a couple of years as my primary blog aggregator. I have looked at a ton of them and, though desktop aggregators offer more features, I really prefer a web-based reader. It&#8217;s just easier to maintain what Ive read across multiple machines. Bloglines has simply dominated the web aggregator market.</p>

<p>About a year ago, I saw that Google had an experimental app call &#8220;Reader&#8221;. Since I&#8217;m a huge google fan, I thought, &#8220;Finally! A worthy competitor to Bloglines.&#8221; After spending a few hours getting all my feed set up (thankfully there was an OPML import) and working with it, I concluded that it was one of the worst web apps I had ever used. It was simply horrible. The UI was inconsistent, it used bad AJAX, standard feature were missing. Disappointed, I went back to Bloglines.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I wondered what ever happened to reader. Since it was part of <a href="http://labs.google.com,">Google Labs</a> what did they decide to do? The boldest thing they could. They re-wrote the whole thing. It is 1000% better. Clean, understandable UI, using AJAX the right way. Needless to say, I&#8217;ve been very impressed so far.</p>

<p>If you already have a <a href="http://google.com/gmail">Gmail</a> account, there&#8217;s not even a signup process. <a href="http://google.com/reader">Give it a try</a>.</p>

Better plan to buy tickets early as they sold out in a few days last year. (They haven&#8217;t annouced when tickets will be available yet.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve used TextDrive for web hosting for the past year. Overall I&#8217;ve been very happy. The server control is unparalleled in a shared hosting environment. My only knock is that their response time can sometimes be a little slow (1-3 days) for support questions. Thankfully I haven&#8217;t had very may.</p>

<p>I just found out that they are increase their service (and their price).</p>

<p>bq. Iâ€™ll say it another way: $15 per month gets you web hosting (5gb, 5 databases, 5 domains, 5gb of bandwidth), online storage (5 users and 5gb), and email, calendar, address book, files and all the other applications in the pipeline (5 users and 5gb).</p>

<p>Seems like a pretty good deal. I&#8217;m especially excited about giving StrongSpace a try. Read more on their <a href="http://joyeur.com/2006/10/13/introducing-joyent-core.">blog</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just got back from Disney tonight. Man, that mouse will take it out of you. Four parks in four days. It was a lot of fun though. I haven&#8217;t checked email but once this past week. It was nice to be unplugged for a while.</p>

<p>I spent most of the night before I left for Disney migrating my &#8220;sometimes active&#8221; blog from <a href="http://typosphere.org/">Typo</a> to <a href="http://mephisto.stikipad.com/help/show/HomePage.">Mephisto</a> Why? Not just because I&#8217;m a glutton for punishment. I&#8217;ve had my eye on Mephisto when I found out that <a href="http://techno-weenie.net">Rick Olsen a.k.a. technoweenie</a> started working on it. I had lunch with he and some other Rails core team members at RailsConf. I have a lot of respect for the guy and the code he churns out. His plugins are some of the best around.</p>

<p>Overall, I like it much better. It&#8217;s not 100% stable, but then again isn&#8217;t even a 1.0 release yet. It has a clean and attractive design for the admin area. I like that it&#8217;s not just for blogs, but can be used for other web publishing sites.</p>

<p>The asset &#8220;bucket&#8221; is a great idea. You can upload assets, then add them to your bucket to carry them around and use them in various posts.</p>

<p>When I was at Rails Conf in June, I stumbled upon a great little service for monitoring the status of your servers, <a href="http://www.montastic.com/.">Montastic</a> This is a very lightweight, <em>free</em> service where you simply add URLs. The service pings each of your servers every 10 minutes and sends you an email if one of them is down.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So we&#8217;re finally taking that trip that every parent expects at some point. We leave tomorrow night for Disney World. I lived in Orlando for a few years in the mid-90s and couldn&#8217;t wait to leave. The heat and tourists were just too much. Now I get to be part of the problem. : )</p>

<p>Hopefully the kids will enjoy it. Be back next Wed. Peace out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been silent for a while. (Did anyone really notice? ; )) As it turns out, I have a new gig that is quite interesting. I left the .NET world and moved back into the ColdFusion world. The funny thing is that in the 3 months that I&#8217;ve been here, I&#8217;ve spent most of my time writing Ruby to automate some of their internal systems. It&#8217;s been a refreshing change. If you begin to see more about ColdFusion, don&#8217;t be surprised.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;m out here in Chicago at RailsConf. It&#8217;s pretty exciting being here with the &#8216;cream of the crop.&#8217; Yesterday <a href="http://www.thunderholesoftware">Chris Johnson</a> and I went to the Rail Guidebook put on by Dave &amp; Mike of <a href="http://www.pragmaticstudio.com/">Pragmatic Studio</a> fame. It was really well done. I&#8217;ll add some more details later.</p>

<p>Funny story though. We had to donate to charity to get in. I happened to be on e of the highest donaters so I got a front row seat, a free lunch with Dave, Mike and some fot he Rails Core team, and an invite to a VIP party last night where I met <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">the man</a> himself. Good times.</p>
