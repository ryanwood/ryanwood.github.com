  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo,">Jeffrey Palermo</a> in a recent blog post makes the claim that <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2006/02/20/138778.aspx.">RAD Kills</a> I feel his pain, especially on the ASP.NET platform.</p>

<p>bq. RAD is quick and satisfies in the short term.  Sometimes it&#8217;s amazing how many features can be created just by some dragging and dropping.  You could whip out an entire system in a week.  It&#8217;s almost too good to be true.</p>

<p>His point is well taken, but I think he&#8217;s aiming his gun at the wrong guy. It&#8217;s Microsoft&#8217;s <em>implementation</em> of RAD that is the problem, not RAD itself. Drag-n-drop, and numerous other features in the MS bag of tricks, encourage a blissful ignorance about what is going on beneath the covers. Even Bill himself stated at PDC 2005 that MS&#8217;s goal is to have developers &#8220;write less code&#8221;. What he <em>means</em> is that they will <em>hide</em> more code from you, so you don&#8217;t have to (and oftern can&#8217;t) deal with the implementation details. When you do need to get to a little bit lower level, you can&#8217;t because the code is auto-magically generated on the fly. I digress&#8230;</p>

<p>The implementation is the issue. Anyone who reads this blog knows that I have been infatuated with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> for the past 9 months or so. Rails, in comparison, provides a very rapid development experience, but without the &#8220;dumbing down&#8221; effect. It answers the RAD call with better, cleaner, more effective code that encourages best practices, intrinsic object orientation, sustainable productivity, and multiple degrees of testing. The Rails core team actually make it <em>difficult</em> to add bad code to the system, all the while giving a RAD experience.</p>

<p>Some may argue that Rails generates code and has <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html">ActiveRecord</a> and others that hide the implementation of common features. Absolutely! That one of the things that makes it a great framework. How is that different from Microsoft&#8217;s WYSIWYG? It uses best practices, adheres to web standards, and gives you full access to the underlying code. This allows to you <em>properly</em> extend the generated code to meet the applications needs.</p>

<p>bq. RAD is quick, but it incurs huge technical debt.  RAD is like consumer credit.  You can have it now, but will you really have time to clean it up later?</p>

<p>Miicrosoft is among the ranks of credit card and car title loan companies that paint a picture of freedom and flexiblility by using their product, yet leave their consumer&#8217;s frustrated, in debt and with many unrealized promises.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft&#8217;s <em>core purpose</em> is not to make us better developers. It is simply to sell another copy of Windows, Office, Visual Studio or whatever. Hence, there is no conflict for them when adding a tool to help someone accomplish &#8220;the end&#8221; (i.e. an application) without understanding the means to that end.</p>

<p>There a delicate balance to be maintained between RAD and quality. Though one must decide what is primary, they can co-exist and even reinforce one another.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I never cease to be amazed by good ole&#8217; MS. At <a href="http://www.datastream.net">work</a> we&#8217;ve been going through the pain of moving from ASP.NET 1.1 to 2.0. They claim that ASP.NET 2.0 is at least XHTML transitional compliant, but beware!</p>

<p>If, in an attempt to be an efficient, compliant coder, you add a javascript include to the <code><HEAD></code> tag using XHTML formatting, form buttons on your page will no longer work.</p>

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript" src="/search/search.js"/></pre>


<p></code>
That&#8217;s right, no post back occurs. You can click and click but the page never gets submitted. Low and behold, once you change it back to the old school method, things work again.</p>

<pre><code><script type="text/javascript" src="/search/search.js"></script></pre>


<p></code>
Go figure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With all the buzz about AJAX, it&#8217;s important to look at the frameworks that are being built to handle the xmlhttp abstraction. <a href="http://www.aspnetresources.com">Milan Negovan</a> wrote a  <a href="http://www.aspnetresources.com/blog/prototype_vs_atlas.aspx">nice little comparsion</a> between <a href="http://prototype.conio.net/,">Prototype</a> an open source javascript library (built into Rails) and <a href="http://www.asp.net/default.aspx?tabindex=7&amp;tabid=47,">Atlas</a> Microsoft&#8217;s (yet to be released) abstraction layer. Here&#8217;s his conclusion:</p>

<p>bq. Atlas and Prototype each has its own groove. I expect server-side developers to gravitate more toward Atlas although the sheer payload of it will be punishing to the end user. I anticipate UI, usability and accessibility craftsmen to choose Prototype to build on.</p>

<p>After playing with both, I feel that prototype is much cleaner, leaner, and more extensible approach. It does however force developers to get deeper into the code and have a better understanding of client-side javascript. Atlas, however, seems to abstract the developer from the details of the code. This is classic Microsoft. &#8220;Just drag this and we&#8217;ll write the code for you.&#8221; It also moves client-side scripting into server-side objects. If you enjoy dragging and dropping rather than coding, then Atlas may be for you. The other downside of Atlas is that, based on the VS2005/ASP.NET 2.0 time to market, we won&#8217;t see a production release for (most likely) years. That really puts a damper on things.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re into (or getting into) any type of AJAX development, it would server you well to get to know what you are building on.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a lot of hype about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> these days. Most of the chatter compares Rails to .NET, Java, PHP, etc. Though those are valid and often interesting discussions, I  think they often miss the most unique difference.</p>

<p>That difference is what the average programmer spends much of their time doing: upgrading and deploying  applications. Let&#8217;s face it. You only launch an application once, but you (or someone else) will be maintaining and upgrading it forever (&#8230; well, at least for longer than you expect to). I don&#8217;t see any communities addressing this nearly as aggressively and ambitiously as Rails.</p>

<p>It is very evident that Rails was built by developers in the trenches, by those living and breathing in the real world of maintaining applications. Microsoft just released ASP.NET 2.0 and VS2005. With all the new bells &amp; whistles, they still don&#8217;t offer a solid solution for deployment and data migrations.</p>

<p><em>Side Note:</em> <em>I also love the fact that Microsoft only offers unit testing tools in the Enterpri$e version. Brilliant! Take a excellent open source tool, nAnt, integrate it into your product and then charge through the nose for it. Now that&#8217;s business model!</em></p>

<p>Enter Rails answer to these two issues: seemless database upgrades with <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/UnderstandingMigrations">Migrations</a> and simply yet powerful deployments using <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17.">SwitchTower</a> Keep on the lookout for follow-up posts on each of these killer tools.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve long been a fan of <a href="http://www.halhelms.com.">Hal Helms</a> He&#8217;s a great teacher, thinker, and &#8220;coach&#8221; of <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/.">ColdFusion</a> I learned a lot of my good coding habits from reading his <a href="http://www.halhelms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=newsletters.detail.">newsletter</a> Although I&#8217;m not doing much CF anymore, I still read it. In his <a href="http://www.halhelms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=newsletters.show&amp;issue=jan2006,">most recent newsletter</a> he notes that his study of Ruby is shaping his view of CF. In fact, he&#8217;s gleaning from Ruby:</p>

<p>bq. I also began studying Ruby, a language that is unabashedly dynamically typed and fully object-oriented. After being immersed in that heady world for a bit, I emerged to again work with ColdFusion. This time, though, undoubtedly influenced by Ruby, I decided to dispense with the pseudo-strong typing.</p>

<p>Go Hal. Keep up the good work. Looking forward to more on this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After committing the cardinal sin on a recent project of killing the production database without a backup the day before launch, I spent some serious time figuring out a solid back up solution. Thankfully I found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/automysqlbackup/.">automysqlbackup</a> Thought the name lacks creativity, the script rocks! It&#8217;s a unix shell script that creates 5 running daily, weekly, and monthly backups of multiple MySQL databases in a very clean directory structure. It&#8217;s highly recommended if you are doing anything with MySQL.</p>

<p>Oh, and thankfully, the host had a backup of the database as of 1am that night. Whew!</p>
