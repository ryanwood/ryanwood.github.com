I know most of the people who read this (all 2 of you) don't use Rails. Maybe you want to, maybe you don't. Either way I'm still going to talk about it. ; )

Anyway, here are a few resources to get someone started:

- [10 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know About Ruby](http://onestepback.org/articles/10things/)
- [Learn To Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/)

I'll add more as I find them. Try it, go ahead, you know you want to.
