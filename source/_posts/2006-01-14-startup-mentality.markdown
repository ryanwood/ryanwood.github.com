I've considered starting my own company many times. It things like supporting my family, lack of customers and the insurance nightmare that keep deterring me. But I still can't completely kill the idea. In the meantime, I'm learning as much as I can on the subject. I really enjoyed reading about [Idealistic Opportunism](http://www.journalhome.com/codecraft/17861/#c5569.) I think I'm a "opportunistic idealist" who wants to be a pure idealist but doesn't quite have the cajones. We'll see.

By the way, I just discovered [Venture Voice](http://www.venturevoice.com,) a  great podcast on this subject. Take a listen if you're interested. Peace out for now.
