I've long been a fan of [Hal Helms](http://www.halhelms.com.) He's a great teacher, thinker, and "coach" of [ColdFusion](http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/.) I learned a lot of my good coding habits from reading his [newsletter](http://www.halhelms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=newsletters.detail.) Although I'm not doing much CF anymore, I still read it. In his [most recent newsletter](http://www.halhelms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=newsletters.show&issue=jan2006,) he notes that his study of Ruby is shaping his view of CF. In fact, he's gleaning from Ruby:

bq. I also began studying Ruby, a language that is unabashedly dynamically typed and fully object-oriented. After being immersed in that heady world for a bit, I emerged to again work with ColdFusion. This time, though, undoubtedly influenced by Ruby, I decided to dispense with the pseudo-strong typing.

Go Hal. Keep up the good work. Looking forward to more on this.
