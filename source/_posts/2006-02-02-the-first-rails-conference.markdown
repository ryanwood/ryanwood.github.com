The first ever [Rails Conference](http://www.railsconf.com) is now open for registration. Keynotes are  by Martin Fowler, Paul Graham, David Heinemeier Hansson, and Dave Thomas. Don't know who they are? [You should!](http://railsconf.org/pages/keynotes

*UPDATE*:) The conference sold out (400 spots) in less than a week. Whew!

*UPDATE*: They opened up another 150 spots. They sold out in less than 24 hours. This should be great!
