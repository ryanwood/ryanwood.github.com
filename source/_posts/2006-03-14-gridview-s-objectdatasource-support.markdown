I was really excited when I first caught wind of the the ObjectDataSource (ODS) control for ASP.NET. Finally Microsoft is helping those that want to implement a true business layer and bind it's results to the UI. 

Many of the "features" simply don't work. I was unable to use the delete functionality. The GridView would not pass the proper data to the ODS. I got this little treat yesterday when I tried to use the sorting feature.

<div style="padding: 5px; border: dotted 1px black; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 10px;">

</div>

_I continue to be dumbfounded._
