I'm happy to announce that I (and a few other brave souls) will be starting a Ruby/Rails user group for the upstate of South Carolina. We are tentatively planning to meet the 2nd Tuesday of each month starting in May.

Please join the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/upstate-rails) for more details.
