I've been a drummer since 7th grade. Currently I keep my chops by playing in a band for the little guys (1-6th grade) at [church](http://www.gracechurchsc.org.) Though it's definitely more tame than some of the bands I've been in previous, it's still a lot of fun.

My son, James, has a fascination for the drums as most little ones do. Through a little magic on the electronic kit, his first solo comes to life...

_Update:) I removed the embedded movie as it was slowing things down._ (Don't have QuickTime? [Download it here](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download.)

Everything) he's playing is real, it's just on a setting called drum solo which creates about 10 hits for every one actual.
