[Hal](http://www.halhelms.com) and [Jeff](http://www.grokfusebox.com) offered up some great [interviewing questions](http://www.helmsandpeters.com/audiofiles/HAPOL-22-TheInterview.mp3) on their podcast, [Out Loud](http://www.helmsandpeters.com.) I wanted the jot these down for posterity and future reference. I hope they can help you land that perfect job. (I'm still working on that one. ; )

h3. Ten Questions from the Interviewee

_Obviously these are beyond the normal (salary, benefits, etc.)_

# What do you consider to be the company's greatest draw for developers? _Why would they chose this company over another?_ 
 _What do developers like about the company?_
# Are there any standards frameworks, or methodologies that all developers adopt?
# What traits do you think are most useful to successful developers at this company? (i.e. curiosity, flexibility, productivity, intelligence, teamwork, etc.)
# Do developers here work primarily in teams or by themselves?
# What are the short-term and long-term goals of the the company (specifically as it applies to development). _Does the manager have any idea?_
# Employees are often unaware of the daily frustrations of managers. What are a few things that you wish developers were more aware of?
# How do developers discover the requirements for a project? (Interaction with customer, [FLIP](http://www.fusebox.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=fusebox.overviewFLiP,) water cooler, etc.)
# How do you know when a project is done? _How do you establish accceptance?_
# What is the company's policy on doing work remotely?
# What policies does the company have to help employees learn and get better? _Code reviews?_
