I can get frustrating working in the MS world especially after falling in love with [RoR](http://www.rubyonrails.com.) Nevertheless, reality is reality -- at least for now. So here are a couple gems for those of us trapped behind the window.

Brian Hogan offers some great write-ups on [Deployment Strategies for Rails on Windows servers](http://www.napcs.com/howto/rails/deploy/.

A) fellow .NET guy also send me a pretty interesting [Visual Studio Plug-in for Ruby](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/static/pages/software/steel_features.html.) Thanks Jason.

What's next?
