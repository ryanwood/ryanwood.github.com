So I'm out here in Chicago at RailsConf. It's pretty exciting being here with the 'cream of the crop.' Yesterday [Chris Johnson](http://www.thunderholesoftware) and I went to the Rail Guidebook put on by Dave & Mike of [Pragmatic Studio](http://www.pragmaticstudio.com/) fame. It was really well done. I'll add some more details later.

Funny story though. We had to donate to charity to get in. I happened to be on e of the highest donaters so I got a front row seat, a free lunch with Dave, Mike and some fot he Rails Core team, and an invite to a VIP party last night where I met [the man](http://www.loudthinking.com) himself. Good times.
