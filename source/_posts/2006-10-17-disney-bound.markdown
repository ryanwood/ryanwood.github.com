So we're finally taking that trip that every parent expects at some point. We leave tomorrow night for Disney World. I lived in Orlando for a few years in the mid-90s and couldn't wait to leave. The heat and tourists were just too much. Now I get to be part of the problem. : )

Hopefully the kids will enjoy it. Be back next Wed. Peace out.
