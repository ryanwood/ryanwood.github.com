I've been silent for a while. (Did anyone really notice? ; )) As it turns out, I have a new gig that is quite interesting. I left the .NET world and moved back into the ColdFusion world. The funny thing is that in the 3 months that I've been here, I've spent most of my time writing Ruby to automate some of their internal systems. It's been a refreshing change. If you begin to see more about ColdFusion, don't be surprised.
