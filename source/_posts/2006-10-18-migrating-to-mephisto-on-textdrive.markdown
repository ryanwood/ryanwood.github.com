Just got back from Disney tonight. Man, that mouse will take it out of you. Four parks in four days. It was a lot of fun though. I haven't checked email but once this past week. It was nice to be unplugged for a while.

I spent most of the night before I left for Disney migrating my "sometimes active" blog from [Typo](http://typosphere.org/) to [Mephisto](http://mephisto.stikipad.com/help/show/HomePage.) Why? Not just because I'm a glutton for punishment. I've had my eye on Mephisto when I found out that [Rick Olsen a.k.a. technoweenie](http://techno-weenie.net) started working on it. I had lunch with he and some other Rails core team members at RailsConf. I have a lot of respect for the guy and the code he churns out. His plugins are some of the best around.

Overall, I like it much better. It's not 100% stable, but then again isn't even a 1.0 release yet. It has a clean and attractive design for the admin area. I like that it's not just for blogs, but can be used for other web publishing sites.

The asset "bucket" is a great idea. You can upload assets, then add them to your bucket to carry them around and use them in various posts.
