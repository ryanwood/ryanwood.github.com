When I was at Rails Conf in June, I stumbled upon a great little service for monitoring the status of your servers, [Montastic](http://www.montastic.com/.) This is a very lightweight, *free* service where you simply add URLs. The service pings each of your servers every 10 minutes and sends you an email if one of them is down.
