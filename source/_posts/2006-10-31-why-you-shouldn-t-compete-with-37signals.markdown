People either love or hate them. Many want to be them. Most small shop want to imitate them. Dharmesh Shah from [OnStartups.com](http://onstartups.com) has a great post on [Why You Shouldn't Compete With them](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/onstartups/~3/41880634/StartupsWhyYouShouldntCompeteWith37Signals.aspx).

bq. Here’s why I think you don’t want to compete with 37signals:  It’s not about the fact that creating simple, usable software is really, really hard (which it is).  It’s not because they have really bright people (which they do).  It’s because the company is a marketing machine.  _37signals squeeze more marketing value out of every dollar they don’t spend than any company I’ve ever known_.
