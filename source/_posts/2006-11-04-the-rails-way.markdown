[Jamis Buck](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org) and [Michael Koziarski](http://www.koziarski.net) have introduced [The Rails Way](http://therailsway.com,) a site where you can upload code and they will analyze it according to best practices (a.k.a. the rails way). This is not for-profit, it is for the community--a way to help others grow in their coding skills. I really do enjoy being a part of this community. 

You can read the intro on [Jamis' blog](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2006/10/31/the-rails-way.)
