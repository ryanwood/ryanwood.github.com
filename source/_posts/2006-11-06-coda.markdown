Hopefully this won't completely kill my new commitment to blogging. We'll see. We add a new member to the family this weekend. Introducing "Coda"...

He's a little black lab we adopted into the family this weekend. He's about 7 (or so) weeks old. And I thought we were moving out of the baby stage.

Here are [some other pics](http://ryanw.smugmug.com/gallery/6535015_BCWCc/1/109594815_ECBPH) of the litte guy.
