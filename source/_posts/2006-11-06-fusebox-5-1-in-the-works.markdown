Sean Corfield, lead developer of Fusebox 5.0, [announced that 5.1 is underway](http://corfield.org/entry/Fusebox_51_is_in_development). It's great to see continual thought and effort being poured into Fusebox in light of all the new frameworks out there. 

Here's a [list of cases](http://trac.fuseboxframework.org/fusebox/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&status=closed&group=status&milestone=Fusebox+5.1&order=priority) that comprise the 5.1 release.
