For the past 6 months, I've been spending a lot of time of time applying object oriented architecture principles to a rather large ColdFusion application. We are employing [Transfer][1] for our ORM, [ColdSpring][2] as our dependency injection engine, and [Fusebox 5.1][3] as our web UI framework. This initial architecture was already in Fusebox 4, so we stayed it rather than moving to [Model-Glue][4] or [Mach-II][5] (the more innately OO CF frameworks).

Be on the lookout for a bunch a new posts around these topics.
