Back at Datastream we used [Vault][3] as a replacement for for Visual SourceSafe. It was a great tool. (Not living (completely) in Microsoft land anymore, I now use Subversion for all source control.) Bundled with Vault was a diff tool. It's apparently grown up into an nice little app. 

[SourceGear][1] just released it's diff and merging tool, aptly named [DiffMerge][2] for **free**. It's available for windows, Mac, and Linux. In fact, depending on the API, I may try to integrate it with TextMate's Subversion bundle to finally get a good visual diff engine on the Mac.
