So one of the hardest things to do in a highly dynamic language is to debug code. If you feel the same way, check out the [ruby-debug][1] gem. Rails 2.0 now has full support for it and it's a real "step forward, into, and out" debugger.

Here's a [great screencast][2] to get you started. If you use [cheat][3] (which I highly recommend), simply type `cheat rubydebug` in the console to see all the options.
