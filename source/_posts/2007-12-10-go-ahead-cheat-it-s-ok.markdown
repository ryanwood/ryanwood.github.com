Though I'm fairly weened from intellisense from my .NET days, I still find myself always needing some type of reference when writing Ruby or Rails projects. There's always a browser tab with the [Rails API][1], [noobkit][2], or [some][3] [other][4] [cheatsheet][5] . While cheatsheets are pretty and all, they are sometimes just a hassle to find and go it when you just need that little syntax helper. So what do I do, I [cheat][6].

This little command line tool provides a wealth of help at the tip of your fingertips.

    gem install cheat

Then see what cheats are available.

    cheat sheets

Or just run one (I use this one *a lot*)

    cheat strftime

There are just hundreds out there. And you can edit (fix) one or add your own. The app is just a command line front end to a wiki. Pretty sweet.
