_UPDATE (May 24, 2009): This was referring to my previous mephisto site. I've now move my blog to [scanty](http://adam.blog.heroku.com/past/2008/11/4/scanty_the_blog_thats_almost_nothing)._

I wanted to play with Liquid, Mephisto's templating engine. So in the process, I thought I'd create a custom theme for this sporadically updated blog.

I've added a few plugins and some code highlighting as well. Fun fun.
