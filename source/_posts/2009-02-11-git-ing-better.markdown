I've very comfortable using [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) for version control. Why switch to [git](http://git-scm.com/), the new [DVCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control) darling?

It really offers 3 main advantages over svn as I see it:
* It's really, REALLY fast
* Branching and merging are trivial
* You can use it offline

That said, you really need to understand how it works to not dig a hole and fall in.
