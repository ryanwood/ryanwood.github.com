Every 6 months or so I do a head's down exploration of new [gems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems) out there in the Ruby world. The speed of progress int he open source world amazes me. For those that are interested, here are some of my recent findings:

- [authlogic](http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/tree/master): an excellent authentication framework for Ruby and Rails. It's quickly replacing [restful\_authentication](http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/master) as the standard.
- [settingslogic](http://github.com/binarylogic/settingslogic/tree/master): a small app config gem similar to [app\_config](http://github.com/cjbottaro/app_config/tree/master).
- [trollop](http://trollop.rubyforge.org/): a *great* command line parser for ruby apps. Beats the tar out of optparse.
- [factory\_girl](http://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/tree/master): a solid replacement for fixtures
- [sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com): a lightweight HTTP server. Very nice.
- [logging](http://logging.rubyforge.org/): a replacements for the aging, outdated [log4r](http://log4r.sourceforge.net/) project.
