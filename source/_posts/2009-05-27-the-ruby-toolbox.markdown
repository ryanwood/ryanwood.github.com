Speaking of gems, [Ruby Inside](http://www.rubyinside.com) has a [great post](http://www.rubyinside.com/the-ruby-toolbox-see-the-most-popular-ruby-libraries-by-usage-1776.html) on the [Ruby ToolBox](http://ruby-toolbox.com/).

> "The Ruby Toolbox gives Ruby developers a categorized overview of 100 or so different libraries ranked on how commonly used they are. It's not perfect as it only pays attention to projects hosted on Github and the ranking system is based on the number of watchers and forks they have, but it's enough to give you a basic overview of the activity within a certain area."

It's a really nice resource to look at when trying to pick a plugin for a particular task when there are just too many to choose from. [RubyForge has stats](http://gems.rubyforge.org/stats.html) as well.
