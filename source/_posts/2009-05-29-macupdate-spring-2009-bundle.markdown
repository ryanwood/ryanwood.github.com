For you mac users, check out the [MacUpdate Spring Bundle](http://www.mupromo.com/). It's similar to the rockin' [MacHeist Bundle](http://www.macheist.com/) that was offered a month or so ago. For $49 you get 11+ great apps including [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/) and [TechTool Pro](http://www.micromat.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=202&Itemid=107). Sold.
