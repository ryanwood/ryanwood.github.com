I was out on a date with my wife last week and in usual fashion, we popped into a Barnes & Noble. She grabbed the lastest edition of People magazine and I wandered over the the "geek" section to browse what's new. I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193435600X?ie=UTF8&tag=knockonwood-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=193435600X">Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=knockonwood-20&l=as2&o=1&a=193435600X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. I figured I would just skim through it put is back but I got hooked. 

I'm not sure why, but I really I got hooked. I bought the book. Being primarily a web developer, I have no idea what I'd even use Erlang for, but I haven't really learned a different paradigm of programming a number of years. So the journey begins. Maybe I'll burn out with it or maybe I'll build a bridge and be able to see where I could use it in the future or maybe it will just help be to be a more well rounded developer. Time will tell.
