My employer called me this summer while I was on vacation at the beach with my family to let me know that the doors to our office would be closed upon my return. Not the best news to get when you're trying to get refreshed and renew the mind.

Thankfully they gave us a three month window to work from home. That window ended October 31, 2009. I have been toying with the idea of making a living as a consultant for, say, about 10 years now but never had the courage to pull the trigger. I guess I can thank First Data for pulling that trigger for me.

I'm not sure what the road ahead has in store for me, but my "spare time" consulting company [Sourcescape](http://www.sourcescape.com/) is now getting pushed to center stage. I'm looking forward to the adventure.
