For the past few years, I've used [Slicehost](http://www.slicehost.com) for all my production hosting needs. I have been very happy with them. Recently I had a need for a new staging server. It takes a good amount of time to set up a site from scratch on Slicehost, which is fine for production servers, but I needed a site up quickly.

I've been using [Heroku's incredible service](http://heroku.com) recently for staging sites. This site however had a ton of uploaded images and I really did want to go through the hassle of setting up S3 for use with Heroku. So I started looking for other options and found [Webbynode](http://webbynode.com).

Their [ReadyStack](http://webbynode.com/features) concept made it really easy to get a VPS server up and running quickly, yet you still have full access to the server as root (same as Slicehost). Their web user interface was clean and enjoyable to use. For my situation, it was the best of both worlds. I wasn't limited by a read-only file system like Heroku and didn't take nearly the time to set up and configure as Slicehost.

I ran into one bug where you couldn't use certain special characters in your root password, but got a prompt reply that they would look into it. Overall, I was very pleased. Good work guys.
