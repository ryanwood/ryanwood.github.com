Well, hello there. I'm Ethan Turkeltaub, and I'm a seventeen-year-old student and web developer based out of Farmington, Connecticut. Right now, I'm working on a project called [Noted](http://ethnt.github.com/noted), but I can be available for freelance work. I'm on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/ethnt), [GitHub](http://github.com/ethnt), and [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/ethan).
